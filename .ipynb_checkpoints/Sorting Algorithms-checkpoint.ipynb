Therefore, the merge operation of merge sort can be implemented without extra space for linked lists.\n",

Let us say we have an integer (4-byte) array A and let the address of A[0] be x then to access A[i], we can directly access the memory at (x + i*4). Unlike arrays, we can not do random access in the linked list. Quick Sort requires a lot of this kind of access. In a linked list to access iâ€™th index, we have to travel each and every node from the head to iâ€™th node as we donâ€™t have a continuous block of memory. Therefore, the overhead increases for quicksort. Merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random access is low."
